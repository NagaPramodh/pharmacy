      "I Pot CV Dry Syrup is a potent antibiotic made up of two active medicines. It is given to children to treat a wide range of severe bacterial infections targeting the ear, throat, lungs, skin, and urinary tract. It works by inhibiting the growth of bacteria thereby preventing the infection spread.\nGive this medicine to your child an hour before or two hours after meals. If your child develops a stomach upset, prefer giving it with food. Make sure to stick to the prescribed dose because it is given keeping in mind the type of infection, its severity, and the age and bodyweight of your child. In case your child gags and expels the medicine within 30 mins of intake, repeat the same dose but do not double dose if it's the time for the next dose.\nSome of the minor and temporary side effects of this medicine include vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, rash, and headache. Usually, these episodes subside once your child’s body adapts to the medicine. However, if these effects persist or become bothersome for your child, call the doctor right away.\nNarrate your child’s complete medical history to your child’s doctor, including any previous episodes of allergy, heart problem, blood disorder, birth defects, airway obstruction, lung anomaly, gastrointestinal problem, skin disorder, liver impairment, and kidney malfunction. This information is critical for dose alterations and for planning your child’s overall treatment.",
